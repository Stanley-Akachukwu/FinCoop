In the case of incomplete funds deduction from CNL Payroll deduction upload:

System should deduct outstanding from the members SD.

if the member has insufficient balance on SD: System sends an exception mail notification to internal control and sets member SD balance to appropriate negative value

Implementation Logic
--------------------

Alter Entities loan Repaymemt schedule 
---------------------------------------
   Period_Principal_Balance  = Contains original balance 
1. decimal Holding_Principal_Balance  = Contains 
   bool IsHolding_Principal_Balance
2. decimal Holding_Interest_balance
   deciaml IsHolding_Interest_balance

Logic to prepare payroll schedule for savings , special deposit , loan repayment
------------------------

Pull from
1. Savings 2. Special deposit 3. Loan repayment.

For savings & special deposit postings => We pull into payroll repayment table

To pull loan balance we need to check existings balance to be sure its fully or partially paid.

When repayment comes in for a loan product (A) => 50k.
